            Raise your wrist and the display instantly comes to life.
            Great screen area to feature a variety of watch faces with multiple complications.

            Always-On technology keeps the display on so you can see information at a glance.
            And with a maximum brightness of 2,000 nits, twice that of Series 8 and SE,
            it’s easier to read in bright sunlight. Detailed watch faces look stunning,
            even when your wrist is down. The edge-to-edge design accommodates your favourite complications and makes tapping,
            typing and swiping easy.
            The largest display, with up to 3,000 nits of brightness — the brightest display Apple has ever designed.
            Large enough to see up to six lines of workout metrics at a glance. Readable even in direct sunlight.
            Always-On technology keeps the display on so you can see key information at a glance.
            The new exclusive Modular Ultra watch face is easily customisable and shows real-time altitude,
            depth or second on the outermost edges, and Night Mode can activate automatically in the dark.
