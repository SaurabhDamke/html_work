            So it is clear that, whatever may be the sport, it is always beneficial for us. Where Outdoor sports make us fit and active, Indoor sports help us in having mental growth. We should never lose a chance of participating in a sport, but it should also be clear that we should not play leaving some important work. Sport is as important as is education.
